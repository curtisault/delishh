module Doc exposing (Body(..), Chrome, Config, Section, view)

{-| The document format: the shared chrome every page wears — the
masthead, the contents rail, section numbering, clause marks, and the
footer.

**The boundary: this module numbers and frames; the page renders.**
`Doc` knows nothing about any component a page draws — a page hands
over its own body content and gets it back inside the chrome. The moment `Doc` learns what one of your components is, it
stops being a format and starts being a page.

**Sections are one ordered list, and the contents rail is derived from
it.** A section number derived from a list cannot disagree with that
list — which is the point. In-prose cross-references ("see §09") are
the one thing still maintained by hand, so reordering sections means
grepping for `§`.

Pure view: no `Cmd`, no scroll tracking. The rail's `#anchor` jumps
are carried out by the shell (`Main.elm` owns the viewport, because
`Browser.application` intercepts every internal link click).

{-| The state the shell owns and every page wears: which section the
reader is in, and what they are searching for.

`active` arrives from boot.js through a port — Elm has no scroll
subscription. `query` turns the sheet into a result list, which is why
it lives here rather than on any one page: search is chrome, the same
as the contents rail it sits in.

-}
type alias Chrome msg =
    { active : Maybe String
    , query : String
    , onQuery : String -> msg
    }


{-| One numbered section: a jump anchor, a short label for the rail,
the section header proper, and the body. `intent` is the header's
small right-hand line — what this section is for, in a few words.
-}
type alias Section msg =
    { anchor : String

{-| How a section's body is numbered.

  - `Clauses` — prose and rulings, so each top-level block earns a
    `§N.M` margin mark you can cite ("the refund clause is §7.4").
  - `Panel` — apparatus with its own internal structure (a table, a
    card grid, a reference list): numbered at section level only.
    Clause marks on a numbered list would be numbering for its own
    sake.

panel over them. The document is what is being searched, so the
document becomes the answer — and the results get the full measure
instead of the rail's 13rem.

{-| A clause, and its own address.

The `§N.M` mark is a link, so prose that says "see §7.4" has somewhere
to point.

**The id is built from the anchor, not the number.** `§7.4` is derived
from where the section sits in a list, so reordering the document
would silently repoint every link ever shared; `sec-what-4` survives
it. What the reader copies is the address bar — no clipboard, no port,
no permission prompt.

{-| The box, in the rail, because searching is navigation and the rail
is where navigation lives. It is a ruled cell like every other control
here.

Below 60rem the rail keeps this and drops everything else: the section
list becomes a horizontal scroller nobody wants, and on a phone
scrolling to a section is cheap.
