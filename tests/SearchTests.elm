module SearchTests exposing (suite)

{-| The index is hand-written, so it is held to the pages in both
directions: every `term` has to be in the section it claims, and every
`alias` has to not be.

The second half is the one that matters. An alias is a word a reader
would type that the prose does not use, and the moment one of them
turns out to be in the text, it is not an alias — it is a term, and
the distinction has stopped meaning anything. That is how a curated
index rots.
